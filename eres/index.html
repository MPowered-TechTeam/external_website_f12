					<span style="font-size:20px;line-height:24px">eRes is the action-oriented living community for budding entrepreneurs at the University of Michigan.</span>
					<ul class="eres-list">
						<br>
						<li>Interdisciplinary team environment</li><br>
						<li>Passionate group of students interested in experiencing entrepreneurship</li><br>
						<li>A close-knit community with a focus on discussing and acting on ideas</li><br>
						<li>Bridges the gap between entrepreneurial education programs and founding a startup</li>
					</ul><br>

						eRes members, all sophomores or older, reside together in Mosher-Jordan Hall, where these budding entrepreneurs develop their leadership and other skills as they participate in our academic and experiential education programs. With a focus on learning, creation, and innovation, eRes is where leaders are shaped and ideas are born. eRes works to impart the knowledge and skills necessary for our graduates to improve themselves, help their communities, and change the world. The world is a messy place, and there has been no better chance in history for daring innovators and change agents to take the stage.
						<br><br><br>
						eRes is currently in its third year (F12-W13), with 12 students living in Mosher-Jordan Hall.  eRes is sponsored by the University of Michigan College of Engineering and Center for Entrepreneurship, and was founded and is run by a team within MPowered.
